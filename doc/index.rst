GATORcell Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the GATORcell documentation. This website is here to aid you through the GATORcell Matlab wrapper. This essentially consists of a series of scripts designed to create ABAQUS input files for GATOR panels, using GMSH as a 3D CAD design and meshing algorythm.

.. note::
   This site is still a work in progress. Hence why there will be some errors, some areas which are inclomplete and a large number of typos. If you think that some of the documentation is wrong log this here `GATORdocs GitHub Issues page <https://github.com/aq18507/GATORdocumentation/issues>`_.
